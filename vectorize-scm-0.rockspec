  summary = "Simple and naÃ¯ve vectorization for Lua.",
  detailed = [[
Vectorized routines akin to numpy's array. Currently only supports 1D arrays, with element-wise operators and common functions such as exp, sin, project, and friends.
Aims to be a replacement for NumLua for newer versions of Lua (since the last commit on that project was 10 years ago), but this is still a very young project.
Contributions are welcome!]],
