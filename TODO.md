# To do

- [ ] Organize code (move vector functions to their own file)
- [ ] Numerical integration for ODEs
    - [ ] Euler
    - [ ] RK4
- [ ] Benchmark tables comparing raw lua implementations vs `vectorize` implementations
- [ ] Something like a derivative analogous to the `trapz` function
- [ ] Matrix operations?
